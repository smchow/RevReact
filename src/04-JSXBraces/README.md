## Instructions

In this activity we demonstrate how JavaScript expressions can be evaluated inside of JSX.

![JSX Vars](../../md-images/03-JSX-Var.png)

The important thing to understand here is that only JavaScript expressions which return a value can be evaluated within the curly braces. Examples include variables, function executions, ternary operators and short circuit evaluations which return a value. Anything you could pass into a function as an argument or assign to a variable will work. If statements and for-loops will not.

Try rendering your name, age, and hobbies inside the JSX!
