# Activity # 8

This activity demonstrates one method of conditionally rendering a component. If `this.state.showLorem` is `true` inside of the App component, the Display component is rendered. Otherwise it is removed from the DOM.

## Instructions

Try utilizing another method of conditional rendering besides using a function. Feel free to mess with this, maybe create another component and conditional render either Display, your new component, or nothing depending on some piece of state in App.
