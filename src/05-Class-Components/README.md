## Instructions

Write code to convert the Unsovled version of the functional component to be a class component. Set num1 and num2 to the class component's state.

Functional components **are** better to use when a component doesn't need to keep track of any of its own internal state that is going to change. Functional components are preferred when possible, as they are easier to debug, test, and require less code to write.

Class components can have their own variables set to their `state`, which when modified, will cause the component to re-render itself, updating the view.
